    "**A schema** is like a blueprint for a database showing the relationships between tables and their primary and foregin keys. In MySQL, the term is interchangeable with database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Table** is a collection of records. Each table should have a primary key and may have a foreign key relating it to another table in the database.\n",
